**Kaggle House Prices Competition**

This repository contains the code and data for my submission to the Kaggle House Prices competition. The goal of the competition is to develop a machine learning model to accurately predict the sale prices of houses based on various features. The dataset contains information on many features for each house, such as square footage, number of rooms, neighborhood, materials used to build the house, etc. 

In this project, I experimented with several machine learning models, including Lasso, LightGBM, CatBoost and XGBoost regressions. However, after performing cross-validation, hyperparameter tuning and other methods, I found that the CatBoostRegressor and XGBRegressor models performed the best on the task.

This repository contains several scripts that can be used to prepare the data, perform exploratory data analysis, create new features, train and evaluate the models, and make predictions on the test set. 

**Results:**
My final submission achieved a root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of 0.12316 on the test set.

P.S. I hope you find this repository helpful in your own machine learning projects. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or suggestions for improvements.
